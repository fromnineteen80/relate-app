## Compatibility Tiers

### Tier Definitions

**Ideal:** Highest natural compatibility. Shared dimensions create intuitive understanding. Lowest friction, highest ease.

**Kismet:** Strong chemistry with manageable tensions. Natural attraction with one or two areas requiring awareness.

**Effort:** Workable but requires conscious effort. Real compatibility exists but differences need active management.

**Long Shot:** Significant gaps in lifestyle or values. Possible but challenging. Requires exceptional individuals.

**At Risk:** Major incompatibilities likely to surface under stress. High failure probability without significant work.

**Incompatible:** Fundamental misalignment in core dimensions. Not recommended.

### Compatibility Logic

**Natural Alignments:**
- Same lifestyle dimension (both Peace or both Thrill) creates daily life compatibility
- Same values dimension (both Traditional or both Egalitarian) creates structural compatibility
- Complementary physical/social dimensions create attraction without competition

**Common Tensions:**
- Thrill + Peace = lifestyle conflict; one feels bored, one feels exhausted
- Traditional + Egalitarian = structural conflict over roles and decisions
- Both high leadership/allure = competition for attention
- Both high presence/charm = may lack energy generation

### Conflict Pattern Predictions

**Pursue + Withdraw:** Classic EFT pattern. Pursuer seeks closeness when stressed. Withdrawer needs space. Each triggers the other. Requires explicit protocols.

**Withdraw + Withdraw:** Issues go unaddressed. Both retreat. Resentment builds in silence. Requires scheduled surfacing.

**Pursue + Pursue:** Escalation pattern. Both push. Neither retreats. Requires cooling protocols.

**Driver Collisions:**
- Abandonment + Engulfment = deadly dance. Her pursuit triggers his engulfment. His withdrawal triggers her abandonment.
- Inadequacy + Criticism = amplification loop. Her criticism confirms his inadequacy. His shutdown feels like proof she's right.
- Injustice + Defensiveness = scorekeeping spiral. Both track wounds. Neither forgives.
