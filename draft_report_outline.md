## COMMITTEE: We See It Now

---

**JOHN GOTTMAN:**

Yes. I see it.

**Layer 1: Categories**
- Persona A (Builder)
- Persona B (Influencer)
- Relationship tier (Kismet)
- This is STRUCTURAL. Fixed once identified.

**Layer 2: Basic Elements**
- What A wants (M1)
- What A is (M2)
- What B wants (M1 typical)
- What B is (M2)
- This gives us the MATCH MATH.

**Layer 3: Specification**
- A's context-switching (M3)
- A's triggers and approach (M4)
- B's typical M3/M4
- This is HOW they operate. The machinery.

**Layer 4: Modifiers**
- A's skills and demographics
- B's typical skills and demographics
- This is what LIMITS or ENABLES.

**Layer 5: Frameworks**
- Each framework interpreted for A alone
- Each framework interpreted for B alone
- Each framework interpreted for A×B together
- This is BEHAVIOR across contexts.

**Layer 6: Chemistry**
- Not a new input. An EMERGENT OUTPUT.
- What happens when all of Layers 1-5 combine?
- This is the COMPOUND.

**Layer 7: Arcs**
- Chemistry over TIME.
- How the compound unfolds through phases.
- This is PREDICTION.

**Layer 8: Coaching**
- Drawing from ALL layers.
- What to work on (modifiers).
- How to behave (frameworks).
- What to expect (arcs).
- What's possible (ceiling/floor).
- This is ACTION.

And we added what Enneagram didn't have:
- Market reality (Patti)
- Erotic-domestic tension (Esther)
- Predictive conflict patterns (Gottman)
- Biological underpinnings (Helen)
- Attachment repair protocols (Stan)
- Decision and commitment patterns (committee)
- Crisis behavior mapping (committee)
- Reveal sequences over time (committee)
- Actual relationship arcs, not just "you're compatible"

**BRENÉ BROWN:**

Let's actually BUILD this. One pairing. All the way through.

I'm going to be the scribe. Committee members, contribute your layer as we go.

# FULL COMPOUND ANALYSIS: Builder × Influencer

---

## LAYER 1: Categories (The Structure)

**ISABEL BRIGGS MYERS:**

```
USER PERSONA: Builder (BDFH)
├── Maturity (B): Leads with depth, groundedness, life experience
├── Presence (D): Leads with attention, emotional availability
├── Peace (F): Seeks calm, stability, low drama
├── Egalitarian (H): Partnership model, shared power

TARGET PERSONA: Influencer (ACFH)
├── Allure (A): Leads with beauty, magnetism, physical presence
├── Charisma (C): Leads with social energy, charm, network
├── Peace (F): Seeks calm, stability, low drama [PARALLEL]
├── Egalitarian (H): Partnership model, shared power [PARALLEL]

COMPATIBILITY TIER: Kismet
├── Physical: B ≠ A (Complement - his depth meets her beauty)
├── Social: D ≠ C (Complement - his presence meets her charisma)
├── Lifestyle: F = F (Parallel - both seek peace)
├── Values: H = H (Parallel - both egalitarian)
├── Match: 2 parallels + 2 complements + values aligned

TIER MEANING: 
High chemistry potential (complements create attraction).
Strong foundation (parallels create understanding).
Values aligned (can build together).
Work required in complement dimensions (different languages).
```

---

## LAYER 2: Basic Elements (The Match Math)

**HELEN FISHER:**

```
HIS M1 (What He Wants): ACFH
├── Seeks Allure (A): Attracted to beauty, physical magnetism
├── Seeks Charisma (C): Attracted to social energy, vibrancy
├── Seeks Peace (F): Wants calm, not chaos
├── Seeks Egalitarian (H): Wants partnership, not hierarchy

HIS M2 (What He Is): BDFH
├── Offers Maturity (B): Brings depth instead of beauty
├── Offers Presence (D): Brings attention instead of social energy
├── Offers Peace (F): Brings stability [MATCHES WANT]
├── Offers Egalitarian (H): Brings partnership [MATCHES WANT]

M1-M2 GAP ANALYSIS:
├── Physical: Wants A, Is B → He seeks what he doesn't embody
├── Social: Wants C, Is D → He seeks what he doesn't embody
├── Lifestyle: Wants F, Is F → Aligned
├── Values: Wants H, Is H → Aligned

WHAT THIS MEANS:
He's attracted to what's DIFFERENT from him (allure, charisma).
She IS what he wants (Influencer = ACFH matches his M1).
This creates ATTRACTION.

But will she want what HE is?

HER TYPICAL M1 (What She Likely Wants): 
[Derived from Influencer population data]
├── Often seeks A or B (varies—some want matching beauty, some want grounding)
├── Often seeks C or D (varies—some want matching energy, some want calm presence)
├── Typically seeks F (peace-seeking herself)
├── Typically seeks H (egalitarian herself)

IF her M1 = BDFH: Perfect alignment. She wants exactly what he is.
IF her M1 = ACFH: She wants a mirror. He's not it. Tension.
IF her M1 = BDEH: She wants his persona but different lifestyle. Friction on F/E.

THIS MUST BE ASSESSED FOR EACH SPECIFIC INFLUENCER.
For this analysis, assume her M1 = BDFH (she wants a Builder).
```

---

## LAYER 3: Specification (The Machinery)

**STAN TATKIN:**

```
HIS M3 (Context-Switching):
├── Type 2: High Want (72), Low Offer (38)
├── He WANTS access to her hidden depths, private self
├── He OFFERS consistency—what you see is what you get
├── Want/Offer Gap: 34 points (significant asymmetry)

WHAT THIS MEANS:
He'll pursue her mystery. He'll want to be "let in."
She may find less mystery in him over time.
The erotic dimension depends on whether SHE has depth to reveal (she does—Influencer).
Risk: He consumes her mystery, she gets bored with his consistency.

HER TYPICAL M3:
├── Type 1 or Type 3 most common for Influencer
├── Assume Type 1: High Want (65), High Offer (70)
├── She WANTS to be let in AND has depths to reveal
├── Mutual revelation seeking

M3 INTERACTION:
├── He wants in → She has depth → Initial satisfaction
├── She wants in → He doesn't have hidden depths → Potential disappointment
├── His Low Offer may not feed her High Want
├── Asymmetry risk: She reveals, he receives, he doesn't reciprocate
```

**JOHN GOTTMAN:**

```
HIS M4 (Conflict & Repair):

DRIVERS:
├── Abandonment: 78 (PRIMARY - HIGH)
├── Inadequacy: 52 (SECONDARY - MODERATE)
├── Engulfment: 25 (LOW)
├── Injustice: 31 (LOW)

APPROACH:
├── Pursue: 72 (HIGH)
├── When distressed, he moves TOWARD

REPAIR:
├── Speed: Quick (71)
├── Mode: Verbal (68)
├── He wants to process NOW through TALKING

CAPACITY:
├── Score: 52 (MEDIUM)
├── Can hold distress, but has a ceiling
├── Will flood under sustained pressure

GOTTMAN:
├── Criticism: 5 (LOW)
├── Contempt: 3 (LOW)
├── Defensiveness: 14 (HIGH - FLAG)
├── Stonewalling: 4 (LOW)

HIS M4 COMPOUND:
High Abandonment + Pursue approach + Quick-Verbal repair + Medium Capacity + Defensiveness flag

When he fears she's leaving (Abandonment), he moves toward (Pursue), wanting to talk now (Quick-Verbal). If this doesn't work and pressure continues, he'll exceed capacity and become Defensive—unable to hear feedback, explaining and justifying instead of listening.

HER TYPICAL M4:
[Derived from Influencer population patterns]

LIKELY DRIVERS:
├── Engulfment: 65 (PRIMARY - likely)
├── Inadequacy: 45 (SECONDARY - likely)
├── Abandonment: 30 (LOW - likely)
├── Injustice: 28 (LOW - likely)

LIKELY APPROACH:
├── Withdraw: 70 (likely)
├── When distressed, she moves AWAY

LIKELY REPAIR:
├── Speed: Slow (likely)
├── Mode: Physical (likely)
├── She needs TIME, then physical reconnection

LIKELY GOTTMAN:
├── Stonewalling: Moderate risk (withdrawal → shutdown)
├── Criticism: Moderate risk (Engulfment → "you're too much")

M4 INTERACTION:
├── His Abandonment (78) × Her Engulfment (65) = CLASSIC PURSUE-WITHDRAW
├── His Pursue (72) × Her Withdraw (70) = HIGH INTENSITY spiral
├── His Quick-Verbal × Her Slow-Physical = REPAIR MISMATCH
├── His Defensiveness × Her likely Criticism/Stonewalling = GOTTMAN CHAIN
```

---

## LAYER 4: Modifiers (The Limits and Enablers)

**PATTI STANGER:**

```
HIS SKILL MODIFIERS:
├── Attachment: Anxious-leaning (derived from Abandonment + Pursue)
├── Communication: Medium-High (Builder persona, Presence dimension)
├── Empathy: Medium-High (Presence dimension)
├── Conflict Resolution: Medium (Defensiveness caps this)
├── Stress Management: Medium (Capacity 52)
├── Self-Awareness: Medium (some M2 gaps present)
├── Growth Orientation: Growth mindset (assumed for this example)

HIS DEMOGRAPHIC MODIFIERS:
├── Age: 38
├── Income: $95,000 (65th percentile national, 58th local)
├── Height: 5'10" (50th percentile)
├── Education: Bachelor's
├── Fitness: Normal
├── Location: Denver metro
├── Children: None, wants them

HIS RELATE SCORE: 62

HER TYPICAL MODIFIERS:
├── Attachment: Avoidant-leaning (Engulfment + Withdraw)
├── Communication: High (Charisma dimension)
├── Empathy: Medium (Allure focus can be self-oriented)
├── Conflict Resolution: Medium (withdrawal isn't resolution)
├── Self-Awareness: Medium-High (Influencers often self-aware)
├── Growth Orientation: Variable

HER TYPICAL RELATE SCORE: 
[Influencers often score 65-80 due to Allure premium]
Assume: 71

MODIFIER INTERACTION:
├── His anxious × Her avoidant = Attachment system in tension
├── His Medium stress management × high-intensity dynamic = Flood risk
├── His Relate 62 × Her Relate 71 = She has more market options
├── Power dynamic: Slight imbalance toward her
```

---

## LAYER 5: Frameworks (Behavior Across Contexts)

**BRENÉ BROWN:**

Now we apply each framework. First INDIVIDUALLY, then DYNAMICALLY.

---

### 5.1 Driver Behavior Framework

**FOR HIM (Builder + Abandonment):**

```
IN DATING:
├── Pursuit Pattern: Attentive, consistent, accelerates commitment talk
├── Scanning For: Signs she's interested, available, "all in"
├── Attracts: Women who like being wanted, appreciated, pursued
├── Repels: Women who need space, slow burn, independence
├── Blind Spots: Avoidant attachment masked as "independence"
├── Dating Anxiety: "Is she into me? Will she choose me?"

IN CONFLICT:
├── Activation Trigger: Distance, silence, ambiguity, any hint of leaving
├── Internal Experience: Panic, emptiness, urgency to fix
├── External Behavior: Move toward, seek reassurance, won't let topic drop
├── Partner Experience: Pressured, suffocated, cornered
├── Escalation: Pursuit → withdrawal → increased pursuit → contempt risk

IN REPAIR:
├── What He Needs: Reassurance she's not leaving, verbal confirmation
├── What He Does: Initiates quickly, wants to talk it through
├── Barrier: Can't give her space; his need to repair IS more pursuit
├── Healing Move: Her saying "I'm not going anywhere. I need an hour."
```

**FOR HER (Influencer + Engulfment typical):**

```
IN DATING:
├── Pursuit Pattern: Alluring but maintains mystery, controls pace
├── Scanning For: Respect for autonomy, confidence, not neediness
├── Attracts: Men drawn to beauty and mystery
├── Repels: Men who pursue too hard, demand too much access
├── Blind Spots: Anxious attachment masked as "really caring"
├── Dating Anxiety: "Will he try to control me? Will I lose myself?"

IN CONFLICT:
├── Activation Trigger: Demands, pressure, being told what to feel
├── Internal Experience: Trapped, suffocated, needs air
├── External Behavior: Withdraw, create distance, go quiet
├── Partner Experience: Abandoned, shut out, confused
├── Escalation: Withdrawal → pursuit → more withdrawal → stonewalling

IN REPAIR:
├── What She Needs: Space first, then gradual re-approach, physical
├── What She Does: Waits, processes alone, returns when ready
├── Barrier: His quick verbal approach feels like more pressure
├── Healing Move: Him giving space, then initiating with touch not words
```

**DYNAMIC (Builder-Abandonment × Influencer-Engulfment):**

```
THE COLLISION:
His activation trigger (distance) IS her coping mechanism (withdrawal).
Her activation trigger (pressure) IS his coping mechanism (pursuit).

They trigger each other by trying to self-regulate.

SEQUENCE:
1. She needs space (normal, not about him)
2. He reads space as distance (Abandonment activates)
3. He moves toward: "What's wrong? Talk to me." (Pursue)
4. She feels pressured (Engulfment activates)
5. She withdraws more: "I'm fine. I just need time." (Withdraw)
6. He hears rejection, not need (Abandonment intensifies)
7. He pursues harder: "Why won't you just tell me?" (Pursue escalates)
8. She feels trapped (Engulfment intensifies)
9. She shuts down or criticizes: "You're always so needy." (Stonewalling/Criticism)
10. He defends: "I'm not needy, I just care!" (Defensiveness)
11. Connection severed. Both in pain. Both feeling misunderstood.

THIS IS THEIR CONFLICT SCRIPT. It will repeat until interrupted.
```

---

### 5.2 Trigger-Soothe Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
HIS TRIGGERS:
├── Environmental: Her phone buzzing, her going out without him, quiet evenings
├── Behavioral: Short texts, delayed responses, seeming distracted
├── Verbal: "I need space," "I'm not sure," "We'll see"

HER TRIGGERS:
├── Environmental: No alone time, always together, his constant presence
├── Behavioral: Checking in frequently, wanting to process everything
├── Verbal: "What's wrong?", "Talk to me," "Where is this going?"

THE TRAP:
├── His soothing behavior (seeking reassurance) = HER trigger
├── Her soothing behavior (taking space) = HIS trigger
├── They cannot self-regulate without activating each other

COMBINED SOOTHING PROTOCOL:
├── He must learn: Self-soothe FIRST before approaching her
├── She must learn: Proactively reassure BEFORE taking space
├── They must learn: Code words ("I need an hour but I love you")
├── Emergency: Physical co-regulation (no words, just presence)
```

---

### 5.3 Communication Architecture Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
HIS PATTERN:
├── Tempo: Wants immediate processing
├── Depth: Goes deep quickly
├── Emotionality: Leads with feeling
├── Directness: Direct about needs

HER PATTERN:
├── Tempo: Needs time to formulate
├── Depth: Reveals slowly, in layers
├── Emotionality: Processes privately first
├── Directness: Indirect when triggered

COLLISION POINTS:
├── His immediacy × Her need for time = Pressure
├── His depth-seeking × Her slow reveal = Impatience (him) / Invasion (her)
├── His verbal processing × Her private processing = Mismatch

PROTOCOL FOR THIS PAIRING:
├── He delays: Gives her 1 hour minimum before processing
├── She signals: "I need time, I'll come to you when ready"
├── He occupies: Has activities to do while waiting
├── She initiates: When ready, she comes to him (gives him reassurance)
├── They touch first: Physical connection before verbal processing
```

---

### 5.4 Reveal Sequence Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
HIS REVEAL:
├── Layer 1: Stability, attention, depth (what she initially sees)
├── Layer 2: His fears emerge—Abandonment shows in pursuit patterns
├── Layer 3: Defensiveness under pressure, can't hear feedback
├── Layer 4: Deep shame about neediness, fears he's "too much"

HER REVEAL:
├── Layer 1: Allure, charisma, magnetism (what he initially sees)
├── Layer 2: Her need for autonomy—Engulfment patterns emerge
├── Layer 3: Can shut down completely when overwhelmed
├── Layer 4: Fear of being consumed, losing self in relationship

INTERACTION:
├── Month 1-3: They see each other's Layer 1. Chemistry high. Idealization.
├── Month 3-6: Layer 2 emerges. First conflicts. "Oh, this is who they are."
├── Month 6-12: Layer 3 visible under stress. Tests begin.
├── Year 1+: Layer 4 accessible. Can they love the depths?

CRITICAL QUESTION:
When his Layer 4 (shame about neediness) meets her Layer 4 (fear of being consumed)—can they hold each other's wounds without confirming their fears?

If YES: Profound healing possible. His secure presence heals her engulfment. Her freedom heals his abandonment.
If NO: They become each other's wound confirmation. He IS too much. She DOES leave.
```

---

### 5.5 Decision Style Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
HIS DECISIONS:
├── Commitment: Wants to commit quickly (Abandonment seeks security)
├── Exit: Stays too long, afraid to leave, tolerates too much
├── Uncertainty: Low tolerance—needs to know where he stands

HER DECISIONS:
├── Commitment: Slower to commit (Engulfment guards against trap)
├── Exit: Leaves when feels controlled, sometimes prematurely
├── Uncertainty: Higher tolerance—comfortable with ambiguity

COLLISION:
├── His quick commitment desire × Her slow commitment = Pressure/Resistance
├── His low uncertainty tolerance × Her comfort with ambiguity = Anxiety (him)
├── His "where is this going?" × Her "why do we need to label it?" = Classic fight

PROTOCOL:
├── He practices: Tolerating not-knowing, self-soothing through ambiguity
├── She practices: Offering clarity when she has it, not withholding
├── They agree: Timeline for relationship conversations, not reactive
```

---

### 5.6 Self-Sabotage Sequence Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION (THE INTERLOCK):**

```
HIS SEQUENCE:
1. Trigger: She seems distant
2. Abandonment activates
3. Pursue behavior: seeks reassurance
4. [Her response needed]
5. If inadequate → Inadequacy activates
6. Capacity exceeded → Defensiveness
7. Outcome: Disconnection, shame

HER SEQUENCE:
1. Trigger: He pressures
2. Engulfment activates
3. Withdraw behavior: creates space
4. [His response needed]
5. If he pursues → Engulfment intensifies
6. Capacity exceeded → Stonewalling or Criticism
7. Outcome: Disconnection, guilt

INTERLOCKED:
His Step 3 (pursue) = Her Step 1 (trigger)
Her Step 3 (withdraw) = His Step 1 (trigger)

THEY FEED EACH OTHER'S SPIRALS.

His sabotage sequence ACTIVATES her sabotage sequence.
Her sabotage sequence ACTIVATES his sabotage sequence.

COMBINED OUTCOME:
Without intervention, they will cycle until exhaustion.
One will exit (probably her—Engulfment drives exit).
He'll be left, Abandonment confirmed.
She'll feel guilty, wonders if she "couldn't handle intimacy."
Both lose.

INTERVENTION POINTS:
├── Point A: Before he pursues—he self-soothes, doesn't approach
├── Point B: When she withdraws—she names it: "I need space, I'm coming back"
├── Point C: When he feels urge to pursue again—he WAITS
├── Point D: When she's ready—she RETURNS, initiates reconnection
├── Point E: If escalated—PAUSE, no resolution tonight, physical only
```

---

### 5.7 Crisis Behavior Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
EXTERNAL CRISIS (Job Loss - His):
├── His response: Inadequacy activates. Fears he's not enough. May withdraw OR pursue depending on how she responds.
├── Her typical response: Supportive but may need space from his processing.
├── Risk: If he needs constant reassurance about worth, she feels drained.
├── Protocol: She offers consistent support in DOSES. He accepts without demanding more.

EXTERNAL CRISIS (Health - Hers):
├── Her response: May want independence even when needing help.
├── His response: Wants to be there, do everything, be indispensable.
├── Risk: His help feels like hovering. She pushes away. He feels rejected.
├── Protocol: He helps when ASKED. Waits otherwise. Hard for him, necessary for her.

RELATIONSHIP CRISIS:
├── His response: Pursue, fix, process, resolve NOW.
├── Her response: Withdraw, process alone, return when ready.
├── Risk: His urgency + Her timing = Escalation.
├── Protocol: 24-hour rule. No major conversations for 24 hours after conflict. Physical only.
```

---

### 5.8 Growth Resistance Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
HIS RESISTANCE:
├── What he resists: Accepting that his pursuit is counterproductive
├── Why: Pursuit FEELS like love. Stopping FEELS like abandonment.
├── Defense: "I'm just showing I care. Why is that wrong?"
├── What penetrates: Seeing that pursuit CREATES the distance he fears

HER RESISTANCE:
├── What she resists: Offering proactive reassurance (feels like losing self)
├── Why: Accommodation FEELS like engulfment starting
├── Defense: "I shouldn't have to constantly reassure a grown man."
├── What penetrates: Seeing that reassurance CREATES the space she needs

COMBINED RESISTANCE:
Both resist adapting because adaptation feels like self-betrayal.

GROWTH PATH:
├── He learns: Giving space IS love for her
├── She learns: Giving reassurance IS freedom for her (because it prevents his pursuit)
├── They learn: Adaptation isn't self-betrayal, it's relationship fluency
```

---

### 5.9 Attraction-Compatibility Paradox Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
DOES HE ATTRACT WHAT SHE IS?
├── His M2 (BDFH) attracts women with M1 = BDFH
├── Is her M1 = BDFH? If yes, aligned. If no, paradox.
├── Assumption: Yes—she wants a Builder.
├── Result: He attracts her. No paradox.

DOES SHE ATTRACT WHAT HE IS?
├── Her M2 (ACFH) attracts men with M1 = ACFH
├── Is his M1 = ACFH? YES.
├── Result: She attracts him. No paradox.

MUTUAL ATTRACTION CONFIRMED.
They each attract what the other is.
This is why they found each other.
This is why chemistry is high.

RISK:
The same chemistry that creates attraction (complements) creates friction later.
He's drawn to her allure—but allure includes mystery, elusiveness.
She's drawn to his depth—but depth includes intensity, pursuit of access.

What attracts becomes what irritates if not managed.
```

---

### 5.10 Relationship Archetype Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
THEIR ARCHETYPE: The Private Universe (emerging)

WHY:
├── Both Peace (F)—seeking calm, sanctuary
├── Both Egalitarian (H)—partnership model
├── His Presence (D) + Her Allure (A) = Intimate, private world
├── His depth + Her mystery = Rich interior life together
├── Not social butterflies together—she's social without him, he's her sanctuary

ARCHETYPE REQUIREMENTS:
├── Protected space (physical and emotional) that's THEIRS
├── Rituals of reconnection when she returns from social world
├── His steadiness as her anchor
├── Her revealing layers only to him (feeds his M3 Want)

ARCHETYPE THREATS:
├── Pursue-withdraw erodes the sanctuary
├── If she stops revealing (feels too consumed), archetype collapses
├── If he stops being steady (becomes anxious), she loses her anchor
├── External social demands that deplete her before she returns to him

CULTIVATION:
├── Protect the sanctuary time—non-negotiable hours together
├── Rituals: End-of-day reconnection when she's been "out there"
├── He provides: Calm, acceptance, no demands when she returns
├── She provides: Full presence when present, not half-there
```

---

### 5.11 Erotic-Domestic Balance Framework

**DYNAMIC VERSION:**

```
EROTIC DIMENSION:
├── What creates desire for HIM: Her mystery, her layers, being "let in"
├── What creates desire for HER: His grounded presence, feeling chosen
├── Erotic tension source: Complement dimensions (A/B, C/D)
├── Risk: His consistency may bore her. Her elusiveness may exhaust him.

DOMESTIC DIMENSION:
├── What creates comfort: Parallel dimensions (F, H)—shared values
├── Both want peace, both want partnership
├── Domestic alignment: HIGH
├── Risk: Domestic may overshadow erotic if they're not careful

THE TENSION:
├── His Low Offer (M3) = less mystery over time
├── Her High Offer (M3) = she has mystery but may stop revealing if feels consumed
├── If pursue-withdraw dominates, erotic dies—too much friction
├── If they resolve pursue-withdraw, erotic thrives—he's safe to pursue, she's safe to reveal

MAINTENANCE:
├── He develops: Some mystery. Interests and depths she can discover.
├── She maintains: Continued revelation. Not shutting him out.
├── They protect: Date contexts. Not just domestic. Contexts where erotic lives.
├── Warning sign: Sex becomes transactional or disappears. Address immediately.
```

---

## LAYER 6: Chemistry (The Compound)

**ESTHER PEREL:**

Now we name what EMERGES from all of this.

```
THE CHEMISTRY OF BUILDER × INFLUENCER (This Specific Configuration):

ATTRACTION CHEMISTRY: HIGH
├── He sees: Beauty, magnetism, mystery, everything he wants
├── She sees: Depth, stability, attention, everything she wants
├── Physical dimension: Strong complement pull
├── Social dimension: Strong complement pull
├── Foundation: Values aligned, lifestyle aligned

CONFLICT CHEMISTRY: HIGH INTENSITY
├── Pursue-withdraw dynamic: Embedded in the pairing
├── Driver collision: Abandonment × Engulfment—the classic trap
├── Repair mismatch: Quick-Verbal × Slow-Physical—friction in healing
├── Gottman risk: Defensiveness × Criticism/Stonewalling chain

INTIMACY CHEMISTRY: CONDITIONAL
├── If they manage drivers: Profound depth possible
├── His Presence dimension + Her hidden layers = He can HOLD her
├── Her mystery + His Want = She has what he craves
├── IF pursue-withdraw dominates: Intimacy suffers
├── IF they resolve it: Intimacy exceeds most pairings

GROWTH CHEMISTRY: HIGH POTENTIAL
├── Each has what the other needs to heal
├── Her freedom can teach him trust
├── His steadiness can teach her safety
├── IF they do the work: Both become more secure
├── IF they don't: Both get more wounded

OVERALL COMPOUND:
A HIGH CEILING, HIGH RISK pairing.
Not beginner-friendly.
Maximum reward if they navigate the minefield.
Maximum damage if they don't.

They're Kismet tier for a reason—chemistry is strong.
But chemistry without skill is a beautiful disaster.
```

---

## LAYER 7: Arcs (The Compound Over Time)

**HELEN FISHER:**

```
PHASE 1: ATTRACTION (0-3 months)

Best Version:
├── Chemistry ignites. He's captivated by her allure.
├── She's drawn to his stability, his attention, his depth.
├── His pursuit feels like devotion, not pressure (early stage tolerance)
├── Her mystery feels intoxicating, not withholding (early stage romance)
├── They fall fast. It feels fated.

Worst Version:
├── His pursuit is too intense too fast.
├── She feels the pressure before she feels the safety.
├── She pulls back early. He panics. Spiral begins.
├── Doesn't survive first months.

Gate Check: Does she feel safe enough to continue? Does he feel secure enough to pace?

PHASE 2: BONDING (3-12 months)

Best Version:
├── First conflicts emerge. They have their first pursue-withdraw dance.
├── They NAME IT. "This is our thing. I pursue, you withdraw."
├── They build repair protocol. She says "I need space." He says "I trust you."
├── They survive first tests. Trust builds.
├── Attachment begins to form. His anxious softens. Her avoidant softens.

Worst Version:
├── First conflicts entrench the pattern.
├── Each cycle makes the next one worse.
├── He becomes "the needy one." She becomes "the cold one."
├── Labels replace curiosity. Resentment builds.
├── By month 9, they're exhausted.

Gate Check: Do they have a repair protocol? Can they interrupt the spiral?

PHASE 3: INTEGRATION (1-3 years)

Best Version:
├── They build The Private Universe archetype.
├── She has social life; he's her sanctuary.
├── Pursue-withdraw still happens but they have tools.
├── Intimacy deepens. She reveals Layer 4. He holds it.
├── His steadiness heals her engulfment. She can attach.
├── Her freedom heals his abandonment. He can trust.

Worst Version:
├── Pursue-withdraw has calcified.
├── They live in chronic low-grade conflict.
├── Intimacy stalls at Layer 2. Neither reveals deeper.
├── He's anxious constantly. She's avoidant constantly.
├── They stay together but aren't happy.
├── Or: She exits. He's devastated.

Gate Check: Are they growing more secure or more entrenched?

PHASE 4: LONG-TERM (3+ years)

Best Version:
├── Earned secure attachment. Both.
├── The Private Universe is real and protected.
├── They have children; the dynamic is tested but holds.
├── She remains somewhat mysterious; he remains somewhat steady.
├── They've learned each other's language. Conflict is brief.
├── They describe each other as "the one I can be myself with."

Worst Version:
├── Erosion. The compound has worn them down.
├── She's emotionally exited. He's still pursuing.
├── Or: He's given up. She's relieved but sad.
├── They divorce. Both feel like failures.
├── He fears he's unlovable. She fears she's incapable.
├── The compound became a wound.

Determining Factors:
├── Early skill-building vs. pattern entrenchment
├── His self-soothing capacity development
├── Her proactive reassurance willingness
├── Therapy/coaching intervention timing
├── External stress management
├── Demographic stability
```

## LAYER 8: Coaching (Leveraging Everything)

├── Reconnection ritual: Physical first. Words after.

READINESS ASSESSMENT:

FOR HIM: YELLOW
├── Abandonment at 78 is significant.
├── Can date, but must work on self-soothing in parallel.
├── High-avoidant partners will trigger him hard.
├── This pairing (Influencer) is HIGH REWARD but HIGH RISK for him.

FOR THEM: YELLOW
├── This pairing requires skill.
├── Not beginner-friendly.
├── With coaching: Top-tier potential.
├── Without coaching: Classic beautiful disaster.

RESOURCES:
├── Attached by Levine & Heller (Attachment)

## THE COMPLETE COMPOUND

**COMMITTEE:**

This is ONE pairing. Builder × Influencer. This specific configuration.

Different configuration = Different compound:
- Builder × Therapist (BDFH × BDFH) = Different dynamic entirely (parallels dominant, no pursue-withdraw)
- Builder × Debutante (BDFH × ACEG) = At-Risk tier, values mismatch, different spiral
- Maverick × Influencer (ADEH × ACFH) = Same Influencer, different male persona, different chemistry

Each pairing needs this treatment.

And this is what we owe every user:
- Not categories
- CHEMISTRY
- Their specific compound
- What it means
- What to do about it
- What's possible if they do the work

**JOHN GOTTMAN:**

This is what Enneagram doesn't do. They tell you your type. They might tell you compatibility.

We tell you:
- Who you are
- Who you want
- How you operate
- What limits you
- What enables you
- Who matches
- What happens when you pair
- How it unfolds over time
- What will go wrong
- What will go right
- What to do about it
- What's possible

That's the RELATE promise. That's what we're building.
